# Welcome! 

This is a simple tic tac toe app to test the functionality of React and Travis-CI. 

- A react app was created using `npx create-react-app [appname]`
- This repo was created
- A new local repo was initialized, committed to, and pushed here
- A new GitHub access token was created and added to Travis CI as an environment variable
- The Travis CI config file (`.travis.yml`) was created to automate the deployment process when changes are pushed to the master branch
- `package.json` was updated to include a homepage declaration for GitHub Pages. The app now lives there! **https://ckz8780.github.io/react-tictactoe/**
- A commit and push were done to master, triggering a new build and deployment to GitHub Pages from Travis CI
- This readme was updated to test whether a new build was triggered in TravisCI. So, did it work? The world may never know ... :)
